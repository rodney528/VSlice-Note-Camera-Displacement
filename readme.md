# Note Camera Displacement
A neat note camera displacement script for Friday Night Funkin'!
* Can change how much displacement there is.
* Speeds up the camera a bit when the displacement takes place.
* Sustains can be toggled to slowly remove the displacement.
* ***Actually resets the displacement when your done hitting notes.*** I swear, most people forget to set it back to 0 after you hit a note. ðŸ˜­

This is not the animation based method, I personally think that method is bad but you do you.

Plans:
* Events for easier mid-song changes.
* A way to mess with the script in the options menu.
